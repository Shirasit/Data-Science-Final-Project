Data Science Final Project Shira And Ariel
Can we predict the popularity of TV show by its characteristics?

The process of getting the answer is built on several stages which are executed by algorithmic functions in Python:

- Getting The Data - Crawling and scrapping a data filled web-site.
- Data Handling - Cleaning currupt vlaues and filling missing data.
- Visualization & Analyzation - Creating a clear way to analyze and show behaviors between the data properties.
- Machine Learning - Creating a trained model which takes the data and predicts if a TV series will get a high Rating by its characteristics
